\chapter{Lay Summary}

Mathematical optimization is fundamental to several data-driven applications. With the growth of big data and hardware technologies, there is a growing demand for developing efficient and scalable optimization algorithms. This dissertation investigates two challenging optimization problems originating from signal processing and machine learning. Our study provides a thorough analysis of these optimization problems and leads to the design of optimization algorithms with better computational efficiency.
