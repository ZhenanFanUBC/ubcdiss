\chapter{Preface}

The primary body of this dissertation is based on a number of collaborative works that either have been published or are currently in the process of being reviewed. The development of all the results herein are based on the active collaboration between myself and my supervisor, Professor, Michael P. Friedlander.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The material presented in \autoref{ch:Dual-Struc-Opt} is the result of additional collaboration with Dr. Halyun Jeong and Dr. Yifan Sun while they were postdocs at UBC. This work has been published in Foundations and Trends in Optimization, 2020; see \citet{fan2019alignment}. 
    \item The material presented in \autoref{ch:App-Sig-Demix} is the result of additional collaboration with Dr. Halyun Jeong and Dr. Babhru Joshi while they were postdocs at UBC. This work has been published in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2022; see \citet{fan2020polar}. 
    \item The material presented in \autoref{ch:App-Primal-Retrieval} is the result of additional collaboration with Dr. Huang Fang while he was a PhD at UBC. This work has been submitted and made publicly available in preprint form; see \citet{fan2021safe}.
    \item The material presented in \autoref{ch:App-AtomicOpt} is the documentation of a open-source package developed by myself and Michael P. Friedlander. The package is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MPF-Optimization-Laboratory/AtomicOpt.jl}. 
    \item The material presented in \autoref{ch:Dual-Fed-Opt} is the result of additional collaboration with Dr. Huang Fang while he was a PhD at UBC. This work has been submitted and made publicly available in preprint form; see \citet{fan2022dual}.
    \item The material presented in \autoref{ch:Val-HFL} is the result of additional collaboration with Dr. Huang Fang, Dr. Zirui Zhou, Professor Jian Pei, Dr. Changxin Liu, and Dr. Yong Zhang while I was doing an internship at Huawei Technology Canada. This work has been published in IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, 2022; see \citet{fan2022improving}. 
    \item The material presented in \autoref{ch:Val-VFL} is the result of additional collaboration with Dr. Huang Fang, Dr. Zirui Zhou, Professor Jian Pei, and Dr. Yong Zhang while I was doing an internship at Huawei Technology Canada. This work has been submitted and made publicly available in preprint form; see \citet{fan2022fair}.
